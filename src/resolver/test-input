        This is the update script
        for target all. As you can see, the main parser
        does not understand jack squat about it. Instead
        it is parsed by a language-specific script parser
        after all the target definitions have been parsed.
        This makes it also possible in theory to use different
        scripting languages and to make them dynamically registrable.
